# Chicago Chat

Litle app I'm currently building that utilizes socket.io for live room chats. I also thought it'd be interesting if I restrict it to chicago (feature-pending) because I live there. 


## Built With

* [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) - Real-Time Engine
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Front-End Library
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html) -  Ahh good 'ol express

## Other
Not currently deployed, but once I get a few minimum requirements done, it'll be up.
